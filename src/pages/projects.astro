            I worked extensively on the backend API, creating custom-design API endpoints using Express(Typescript) for handling user(s)'
            data, and managing the entire data fed to the client side. Built to be optimized for speed and efficient data retrival and
            optimized search queries.

          <p>
            I led the engineering team building Entrecore, a platform that actually makes sense of all the messy business data scattered across emails, reports, and random files. You know how over 80% of important business info just sits there unorganized? That's exactly what we're fixing.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role was architecting the core system that takes all that chaos and turns it into something useful. Instead of executives spending hours hunting for information or getting unreliable insights, they can now see clearly and make decisions confidently. It's like clearing the fog so leaders can actually see where they're going.

          <p>
            I spearheaded building LookingToHire because hiring is honestly broken for most companies. We created a platform that handles everything from posting jobs to actually getting great people onboarded, without all the usual recruiting headaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cool part is how we automated the tedious stuff - resume screening, candidate ranking, interview scheduling - while keeping the human touch where it matters. I focused on building features that actually help hiring teams work together better and find people who'll thrive, not just tick boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's built to be fast and intuitive because nobody wants to fight with clunky recruiting software when they're trying to build their team.

        <div slot="description">
          <p>
            I led the team creating YCC for the superyacht industry - basically connecting skilled maritime professionals with yacht opportunities worldwide. The maritime world has some pretty unique challenges that regular job platforms just can't handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built a system that actually understands things like STCW certifications, maritime licenses, and all those international regulations that change depending on where the yacht is sailing. It's not just about matching skills - it's about making sure everyone's properly certified and compliant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform works great on mobile since yacht crew are constantly moving around. We made it easy for yacht managers to find qualified crew and for maritime professionals to showcase their certifications and experience properly.
